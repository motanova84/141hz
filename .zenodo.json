  "description": "Scientific reproducible repository confirming a spectral component at 141.7001 Hz predicted by the Noetic Unified Theory. This analysis uses open data from LIGO's gravitational wave observatories to perform spectral analysis of the GW150914 event, focusing on the ringdown phase where theoretical predictions suggest the presence of a specific frequency signature at 141.7 Hz. The repository includes complete data processing pipelines, analysis scripts, and visualization tools for reproducible science.",
