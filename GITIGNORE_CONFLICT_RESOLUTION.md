# .gitignore Merge Conflict Resolution - PR #63

## 🎯 Summary

Successfully resolved the merge conflict in `.gitignore` between branches:
- `copilot/optimize-vacuum-energy-function`
- `main`

## ⚔️ The Conflict

### Branch: `copilot/optimize-vacuum-energy-function`
```gitignore
results/
# But allow vacuum energy visualizations
!results/figures/vacuum_energy*.png
```
**Intent:** Only allow vacuum energy PNG files in results/figures/

### Branch: `main`
```gitignore
results/
# But keep verification figures
!results/figures/
!results/figures/*.png
```
**Intent:** Allow all PNG files in results/figures/

## ✅ The Resolution

```gitignore
results/*
!results/figures/
results/figures/*
# Keep verification and vacuum energy figures (PNG files)
!results/figures/*.png
```

## 🔍 Why This Solution?

### 1. **Fixed a Critical Bug**
The original patterns (`results/`) had a flaw: you cannot un-ignore subdirectories of an ignored directory in Git. Changed to `results/*` to allow selective un-ignoring.

### 2. **Merged Both Intents**
- ✅ Allows vacuum energy PNG files (satisfies copilot branch)
- ✅ Allows all PNG files in results/figures/ (satisfies main branch)
- ✅ More maintainable - no need to update .gitignore for each new visualization type

### 3. **Clean and Precise**
- Only PNG files in `results/figures/` are tracked
- All other files in `results/` are ignored (including non-PNG files in `results/figures/`)
- Keeps the repository clean while allowing visualization outputs

## 🧪 Test Results

All 6 tests passed:

| Test | File | Expected | Result |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `results/figures/verificacion_teorica.png` | Tracked | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | `results/figures/vacuum_energy.png` | Tracked | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | `results/figures/random_plot.png` | Tracked | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | `results/data.csv` | Ignored | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | `results/figures/data.txt` | Ignored | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | `results/subdir/file.txt` | Ignored | ✅ PASS |

## 📊 Pattern Explanation

```gitignore
results/*              # Ignore everything directly in results/
!results/figures/      # BUT allow the figures/ directory
results/figures/*      # Ignore everything in figures/
!results/figures/*.png # BUT allow PNG files in figures/
```

This creates a precise filter:
- ✅ `results/figures/*.png` → **Tracked**
- ❌ `results/figures/*.csv` → **Ignored**
- ❌ `results/*.txt` → **Ignored**
- ❌ `results/other_dir/*` → **Ignored**

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Backwards Compatible:** Existing tracked files remain tracked
2. **Future-Proof:** Any PNG visualization can be added without modifying .gitignore
3. **Clean Repository:** Non-visualization files are kept out of version control
4. **Satisfies Both Branches:** Merges the requirements of both conflict sources
